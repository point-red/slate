# Master

Master data represents the business objects that contain the most valuable, agreed upon information shared across an organization.

Master data is usually non-transactional in nature, but in some cases gray areas exist where transactional processes and operations may be considered master data by an organization. For example, master data may contain information about customers, products, employees, materials, suppliers, and vendors.
